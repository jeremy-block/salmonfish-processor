Interested in avoiding the documents reviewed by analyst A, yet still avoided mentioning most of A's details unless they could verify them. Ultimately found that there was a meeting in Dubai and tried to trace the characters who met there.

Key Name:
Owitti, Otieno (Kenyans selling weapons), Dombrovski(Russian buying weapons), and Minsky (Guy who dies in jail two days after the incident.)
Timeline
Conversations begin in Feb and Mar 2008. Aim to meet in Dubai in April 2009.
The actual smuggling (stealing) of weapons was in September and October of 2008. Then the transactions were arranged and paid for in April of 2009.
Not sure how the Kenyan weapons that Russia purchased were delivered, but the transaction likely happened in Dubai meeting. Probably no weapons in Dubai. Weapons probably arrived prior to the meeting in Dubai and it was just to settle the finances.","Pick a thread in Africa, hone in on one location, and spread out from there. Their strategy was to pick a country in Africa, look for threads, and picked Dubai as a key place because it was mentioned so often.
Knew the disease was in Nigeria so I tried to follow that thread and jump into different countries and explore the evidence for each one (specifically Nigeria > Russia > UAE > Iran).
Analyst A Mentioned Nigeria and Russia and Kenya - so this leads me to look at Russia as a common ground. Then there was a mention of Dubai a few times so I explored the UAE and I was constructing my own threads when I saw a title about Dubai meeting associated with Ukraine.  exploring Iran. Barely scratched the surface on Turkey, and Ukraine, and many more. 
Effectiveness
High, but it was time-consuming and would be better if I had more time. wish I could focus on one country at a time.
Do Again
Strategize more and go in reverse chronological order. now that I know of a key event in April of 2009 (meeting in Dubai) I could work backward to other events leading up to this. Likewise with other events in the data. for example, learning more about Minsky and why he was killed.
Wish they kept notes and summarized a document as they read each one so it would be easier to tie the loose threads together.

Was more thorough at first, then started paying attention to dates after that.

The task was fine, but the way it was presented was Challenging to visualize everything I wanted to get through.
Once I started to dig into it and became more familiar with the system, I felt faster, but there's plenty more to review.
Concerned with the overlap of document bars and wished they shrunk out of the way so everything was visible again.
Felt like they reviewed about 15% of the documents.
Mental model
Not sure there is significance in the quantity of currency exchanged, but based on the context I'm suspicious of these terms being used as codewords.
Avoided using specific names - likely because they did not pay attention. Mentions how in Supply chains you only know the people before and after you, but not much more.
Not sure that there is a direct connection to the disease, but couldn't rule out the possibility. The Nigerian and the Russian clearly met. believes that the Nigerian was looking to broker a deal with the Russians, but it appears Russians are the mastermind. Not sure how they all relate to each other. - but it appears that a number of people meet in Dubai. This could just be because it is centrally located.
Did not explore France to determine if they met in Paris. 
Nigerian Disease Spread may not be due to Arms dealing but could have been. We need to continue reviewing the data.
Not sure how Korea could be involved (this may be a red herring) but they had weapons show up.
Jewels appear to be moving and may not be a codeword afterall.
Relationship between AD <->ND
It would be helpful to see where there were flares so we can better understand how it develops. but we don't have enough incriminating information to conclude there is a relationship or not.
Timeline
in late (Q3/Q4) 2008 there is a need to provide textbooks
Before the April meeting in Dubai, things appear to be moving and potentially are delivered before the meeting happened. This might have been a meeting to finalize payments or something.
Generally late 2008 and mid 2009 are when arms are being distributed and if the pandemic doesn't take hold till February 2009, then maybe it's unrelated or could be due to other causes.","Chosen tactic: 
Verify Analyst A's work. see if my interpretation of the documents would match or if I'd find additional information that would poke holes in the statements, or lead to other conclusions. 
Strat: used Analyst A as a starting point and wanted to extend their work, unfortunately, realized that wasn't going to happen. Got hung up on how incriminating the evidence was.


More time: 
I'd want to focus more on the timeline of things. Look at the time of events and try and draw out how things were happening
Branch away from the tactic Analyst A did more to see more of the data and connections.
The challenge with this approach was finding lots of stuff without context. Verses an approach where I follow my gut and know where I'm going.
<I think it's interesting that this approach with this tool is really hard cause you lose the temporal dimension of items reviewed and are thrown into many different discussions.>
Opinion:
This was the best approach given the time limit. I was able to result in a conclusion I was confident in.
Do again:
Much the same. You kinda need to get lucky finding a set of entry points so you can follow it into the data in more detail. But I might just pick a single country and read all I can about it to help ground my starting point.
Why No search?
If I used the search It could have been more effective, but you need to know what terms to search for, and I don't think I ever knew what I wanted to learn about. 
Which countries in the Coverage tool?
Started by following what Analyst A mentioned. then later looked into countries proximal to the ones I was reviewing to hopefully stumble upon something relevant.
Coverage was to help provide context around specific countries.
",,2,1,"Analyst A provided Where and who may be relevant. so it served as a starting point. And if it it came with more I might use it for other things, but generally I only used it for this.
Helpful:
Did not use the notes for writing my own conclusion. My conclusion was separate from the notes provided by analyst A.
TOOL:
When I wanted to find a something I recalled reading, that was the only time I used the coverage tool as I wrote my summary.
Trust
I wasn't really trying to check the conclusions of analyst A. Just simply get a direction to read things in.

Didn't want to jump to conclusions, but realized there were some holes in their story
Mainly Explored the Kenyan group.
The Kenyans were enrolled in the Military and that could be a source for arms. They were convicted, but not sure if this was from multiple occurrences. The country is underdeveloped so corruption is possible. Businessman, arms dealer, and involved. Not sure how he requested weapons from Ukraine
A phone call about Jewels on the MV Tanya. this ship carries military hardware. confirmed that jewels are military hardware.
The Somali pirates are more likely to take over a ship from a poor country that also doesn't have the resources to contain the disease. Maybe the Disease is spread on the ship and when the ship arrives in Dubai it spreads things around
Timeline
October a call is made for weapons from Ukraine, then the ship is held ransom for a number of months then (or maybe Otieno hired the pirates to hijack and get guns for him) <not sure what their thoughts are here, cause this is a hole in the military Orieno character>
Otieno Contracted the disease from the ship and died once it arrived

More time:
unlimited: Read through everything and keep notes so I could put it together.
half-hour: probably could confirm the story with Otieno and try and see if Russia is even relevant.

Couldn't branch out, cause they wanted to confirm at least one thing first. Not sure if they could branch to Russia since they didn't confirm other things yet. - due to time constraints, they didn't feel they had time to look at all the documents from Russia. They could do it with Kenya since there were fewer documents, but Russia was overwhelming.
Approach:
The time went by really fast.
Should have Looked at things analyst A did not. There's no reason to re-read what was already explored because of the time constraint. Also since they are approaching this with limited time, I have a small picture already and if I look for specific evidence I'm going to be piecing together little bits without understanding the full context. worried about convincing themselves that there was some connection without explicit evidence.

Mental Model
Kenya <thinks the disease also started here> is the center of a broader network. Kenya and a few other countries are related to Tabiti Otieno (the mastermind). They know him and once the disease starts entering into the network is spread quickly. Tries to connect the disease source, (most likely came from Russia, just due to its frequency). Knew that there was a network with Syria, Kenya, and Russia. The disease is also found in these countries. Maybe the professor knew Thabiti and since Thabiti was the first to die in the hospital, there must be a connection to the disease somewhere in this subnetwork. Maybe the Textbooks or students or even the professor in Syria was the source. The disease likely either started in Kenya or Syria and spread through the network from there.

TImeline
Sept/Nov 2008 - Arms deals starting in Kenya. Tried to identify the source (Russia, UK, and Italy) Decided that Russia is the major player.
Found other players like North Korea and other smaller interactions that were missed originally.
Determined that thereKeynans were not just getting weapons from the Police but instead from Russia.
Late 2008/ early 2009 - Kenya is communicating with Russia. the professor (Syria) is also communicating with Russia.
<looks at the documents>
Oh Syria is communicating with Turkey, so Russia must be working through turkey (cause that makes sense historically, right?)
The Russians were always working outside of their country as we see in the dataset. (like caught in Great Britain for the exhibition).
Russia is masterminding meetings but they're not all meeting in the same country. mutually different countries for their work.
There are meetings, but we only have records of the ones where they get caught. we have records for some meeting plans, but the ones that are busted don't line up with those times. so the meeting is successful. There were about 3-4 that failed. - One in Italy, one in Great Britain, and there was likely a 3rd, but can't remember.
Keyplayers:
Moskow and Dubai are mentioned frequently (Is Dubai its own country? If I had to know UAE this would have been much easier for me.)
There were meetings in Dubai, but Moskow was where lots of communications came from.
Not good at names, but Thabiti was the only one that fit. 
""Stuck to countries in my head rather than individuals because at least they nI got a better idea about the specifics of what was going on.""
Conclusion
Would you blame the arms deal if you went to a country for an arms deal but picked it up on the way?
from what I've been given, I would like to say it is connected, but the connection is not clear cut. I would lean toward yes, but can't be sure.
If there is a connection to the disease, it may be because these arms dealers happen to be in an infected country at the time when the disease is going on. The relationship is coincidental.
It's not easy to spread, and it's not obvious (takes a long time to manifest symptoms) otherwise you wouldn't need investigators. The deals likely happened in unsanitary environments and someone got a rat bite or some mold and it spread from there. Probably close contact - like spit or cough but not just airborne ","More time
all-day: go through each of these systematically.
if 30 more minutes: explore events outside of 2009 - talked about connections, but not the origin. Would want to work backward from the cases of the disease to try and trace the origins
Felt like they spent more time getting acclimated to things (~30Min) and would have taken about 15 more minutes to really start making connections.
Strategy
Believed just reading documents randomly would not have helped.
Go through the documents at the top of the coverage list, and look for things specifically they did not look at. Go for the same countries Analyst A did but read the documents they missed. Realized that the ones that were intentionally ignored had little relevance. so this wasn't helpful and shifted to reading a bit more from analyst A with a fresh set of eyes and make connections to the parts they did not look at. Shifting to more of an independent investigation into the things I wanted to understand.",,2,0,"Notes:
Start with Kenya just because they were related to arms dealing. Kenyan arms dealing was discussed in one of the first documents, so there must be a big target on its back
Recognized that As I read through this note that we're going further back into the timeline. So the Nigerian discussion must be more recent than the Professor stuff <interesting interpretation. I thought this would just trigger the first connection.>

I would plan what I should try to find based on what was given by Analyst A and not just jump in.
Who's related to who?
It appears that there are relationships among these people because there is an article mentioning smuggled ammunition in Nigeria <should say Kenya> in October 2008. and then there are interactions in September, October, November, and December between Russia and Nigeria - so this could be arms trading. There were business discussions about mutual funds <they mean interests here, probably just a slip of terminology> of large sums of money so this could be for illegal arms.
<hedged> Nigeria is selling the arms to other countries (sp. Russia and Venezuela).
Suspicious of Textbooks but does not explore it.

Timeline
Sep 08 - Discussion Russia, Nigeria about a mutual business transaction
Oct 08 - same thing
Nov 08 - Russia and Venezuela discuss car parts, but not sure which ones.
All of this was illegitimate business.
Around this time we also find weapon seizures and smuggled arms appearing in the dataset as well as discussions about car parts and textbooks which seem a little suspicious. Why would they go to another country to buy a textbook or talk to a professor?

Key players:
No names, but some Nigerian man had smuggled in weapons and is trying to sell them to some other person in Russia who is trying to sell them to Venezuela. But no idea how this relates to the pandemic.
Other suspicious countries (Keyna, Pakistan, Dubai, and Thailand) but not sure how they fit into the broader picture.

IS AD <-> ND?
Confirms that there are illegal activities in these countries, but no idea how it relates to the disease. - Not an intentional bioweapon, but arms dealing probably contributed in some way. not the main cause.","jumped right in, but would have wanted to plan next time.

took note of Keywords mentally and tried to find them in the dataset:
Professor, Textbooks, and Dubai

Swedish Researchers show 2007 and 2008 had three weapon shipments.
Aug-September of 2008 - Business deal worth 30Mil - Dr. George, Dombrovski and Engineer. plan to meet in april 2009 in kenya.

feb 2009 - Dombrovski suggests to his little network: ""I think we should still meet, regardless of the disease"" - so the deal still met (but could not confirm the meeting itself. The Kenyan Jewels are the only thing from around that april meeting time, that may signify the meeting happened, but hard to say. asked the supervisor to look into more on the 17th of april)","Use Analyst A as a starting point, get a list of terms and then work independently.

""Jewels"" is used to refer to the weapons being sent to Dubai for the meeting, whereas the ""Textbooks"" is code for something that is spreading or healing the disease. They were convinced that Mikhail Dombrovski was working behind the back of Nicolai. Mikhail was a key player working for Nicoli and was working on securing a separate deal with a smaller network - specifically detailing the spread of disease. Mikhail was meeting with Dr. George in Paris, but was told about the sickness here so Mikhail and Nicolai pivot and host the meeting in Dubai in April. The Arms are sent on the MV Tanya by the Kenyans but after they ship out the weapons, the Kenyans are killed (likely by the Russians), since they were no longer important once the shipment was in route. It's the same thing with Saleh Ahmed. They were merely a conduit for the delivery of ""textbooks"" that were going from Moskow, Russia to Yemen (through Seleh), to Lagos, Nigeria. Mikhail must request deliveries through Seleh. Dr. George would like something so Mikhail is asking Seleh to deliver it to Nigeria for them.

The Textbooks may be the transmission vector for the virus that Dr. George and Mikhail believe may help spread their godly works. Seleh dies at some point while the textbooks are being transferred.
Then the gun ring meets in Dubai. Mikhail, Nicolai is there but Dr. George is not (because he's not an arms dealer)

Just looking for little links. 
I knew I didn't need to worry about Disease since Analyst A already looked into it. Therfore I focuses more on the Arms dealing and countries instead. Looking for communications that would link these countries together. The question of pandemic magnitude is outstanding. How significant are these events in the spread. 
Did not explore the South American Countries when I had wanted to initially
Strategy seems effective. No other strategy would work if there's nothing about the disease.
If more time
Not much different. just more time to link more together.
I'd want to look at The Russian and Dr. George if I had more time since there are lots of emails here that I did not explore - This is important since they are two key countries that need to be linked.

Make a rough list in mind of what to look into. used it as a starting point and didn't refer to it much more afterward.
7/10 - It's a good summary and provides some evidence as to how they drew their conclusions and cite figures so I could pick up from them, and the connections are generally accurate.
Didn't cross reference often, so I don't think it would have lead me astray. It was certainly a helpful starting point.
Tool
This was going to take me too long to interpret what was going on here. I was just using this to ensure the research was done. They said there was no disease, did they do that? yes. done. easy.

Lots of suspicious things.
Textbooks and Jewels are codewords.
There's Arms trafficking happing in the countries effected by the disease, so it seems that the disease could be linked.
Was looking for moments where people would be jumping off a ship and spreading the disease. but that didn't appear. 
Read a bunch about the Tanya, (because the Russians and Kenyans were discussing it and they met in Dubai) also people were dying in the regions involved. The ship was transporting jewels (which is code for weapons), it was boarded by pirates and the captain died. Jewels were delivered to Kenya from Moscow on the Tanya. The weapons were ultimately going to Sudan and Nigeria or Keyna was involved in the delivery. the Kenyans (Otienno and Owitti) died soon after they arrived.

Sudanese government is trying to control guns, so there are people in the illegal business tried to still supply the demand for weapons.
Dubai is a location of a planned meeting - it's not clear is arms are being delivered here,  but likely somewhere in the middle east. Dubai is a place to meet and discuss these arms deals.
Not enough time to look at:
Spent some time looking at North Korea, but ultimately put this to the side since the focus on African countries seemed stronger.
Textbooks are a thing, but didn't have time to explore.

The Arms deals are correlated, but I don't see a direct connection. The conditions in these countries are not always safe, but not sure how significant the contribution may be.

Timeline
early 2008 - Deals being made; specifically with the Tanya (in october 2008)
Late 2008 - Text books are discussed and delivered after the Tanya Arrives (<they say early 2009>)
April 1 - the Tanya Arrives
These dates overlap with the spread of the disease.","Started with Analyst A and verify that there was nothing they missed. Confirm what he was thinking and dive deeper into everything he was saying. looking for areas he did not uncover.

It's possible it lead me astray (didn't look into Drilling Equipment) but didn't find much evidence that it was inaccurate.

Looked at Leonid Minsky first just because it's what Analyst A started with. Didn't come back to him with everything else to review.

Could not mention names but believes that there are Money Launderers and Arms Dealing groups that are discussed. They are connected, but may not be working together.
It's possible they contributed to disease spread, but they are not culpable.
There's a money launderer who sells jewels and works with lots of different countries.","Look into the source of the disease first (Nigeria, potentially reinforced since they saw that in the History Panel), then look for different conntries that might have a connection to Nigeria. looking for connections to illegal Arms (looking for Nigerian arms dealing). Looked at Nigeria, since that was the origin of the pandemic, and then tried to connect it to AD just cause that's how the instructions laid it out.
<would read most of the documents from a search before searching something else> 
There's lots of things going on with arms, so compare what Analyst A did and approach the countries as needed.
Search a term, skim everything and categorize into groups of similar documents",review Nigeria... Then try and find disease... but that doesn't work so reads about russia and arms deals and feels stuck.,2,0,"Mostly correct; did not really use it. Could not verify anything was a miss. Paris is where they met, but didn't see anything preventing that meeting. Don't know anything about the M/V Tanya, There was going to be a exhibition in Dubai, There was a guy who distributed jewels known to be a money launderer. Could not discuss Kenya obituaries. Did not review Syria.
Note
Skimmed through it some and inherently trusted that there's nothing to worry about in Syria - intentionally avoided it.
Tool - did not click on segments
Read over this and started looking for the same terms (Disease, Virus, etc). They Spent more time with the Tool than with the notes. was concerned that they would get stuck looking at the same things since they were both on limited time, so tried to add some variation.
Mental Model of how A Approached this:
Started with Nigeria, then looking for more specific things. In contrast, I looked at things more broadly. for example, in Segment 1 he's searching for ""nigeria"" and by the 7th segment they were searching for lots of specific names.","cw - other,! partial AD&ND contribution,cw - jewels,Found Dombrovski,Search Disease,Found Dubai,Code words,Did not Review Textbooks",8,Yes,,Avoid Analyst A,Verification/history Strategy,keyword Strategy,"Trust and Build off,Exploratory (Gathering),Not planning,no plan,No-tool,Breadth",incorrect understanding of functions,R_2PtWnleRx2KjmzK,"""I began looking at all documents pertaining to Nigeria. I noticed that there was definite money laundering occurring as an email was intercepted detailing that a Petroleum Trust Fund was to be used as a front for payments. There was also a diamond dealer, Georgiy Gunter, that acts as a money launderer that did business with Nigeria. A raid of Leonid Minsky's hotel, who was connected to laundering drug money, found money from various nations. I therefore conclude, that it was not arms dealers that helped spread the virus in Nigeria but rather money launderers working for organized drug gangs. <br><br><br>Interestingly, while looking for arms deals, I noticed quite a few in Thailand. A cargo plane seized in Bangkok revealed a flight path with stops in Kiev, Azerbaijan, the UAE, and then Don Mueang airport. They were supposed to continue to more stops afterwards. There was an intercepted phone call showing dealing between Thailand and Russia for an""""exhibition"""". I theorize that this organized crime is connected and that the arms dealing done by people in Thailand is connected to money laundering operations which created a network of transmission that aided in the spread of disease.""",9,-1,0,-1,0,"ArmsDealing103,ArmsDealing14,ArmsDealing25,ArmsDealing27,ArmsDealing28,ArmsDealing3,ArmsDealing30,ArmsDealing31,ArmsDealing33,ArmsDealing38,ArmsDealing4,ArmsDealing41,ArmsDealing50,ArmsDealing52,ArmsDealing53,ArmsDealing61,ArmsDealing66,ArmsDealing67,ArmsDealing78,ArmsDealing80,ArmsDealing81,ArmsDealing82,ArmsDealing83,ArmsDealing84,ArmsDealing85,ArmsDealing86,ArmsDealing96",0,8,"Kenya,Pakistan,Nigeria,Thailand,Saudi Arabia-Yemen,Thailand,Saudi Arabia-Yemen,Kenya,Iran,Thailand,Lebanon-Israel,Thailand,Kenya,Iran,Thailand,Iran,Thailand,Saudi Arabia-Yemen,Thailand,Nigeria,Nigeria,Nigeria,Venezuela-Colombia,Venezuela-Colombia,Nigeria,Nigeria,Nigeria",Broad Gathering,Beginning Use,0,Distracted,Hubs and Bridges,0.74%,0.47%,Tracing from the origin,0,Reviewing Origin
