Within the related documents, the only mention of disease is the one specifically in Nigeria. Since the documents do not discuss disease in the countries it spread to, a connection to the illegal arms trade has to be heavily based on inference. Additionally, it is important to consider the scale of the illegal arms trade in relation to the speed that the disease spread. The main trading system seems to be between Nigeria and Russia, based on the level of communication. The list of countries that the disease spread to contains countries not involved in the illegal arms trade to an extent that would merit a connection. It is unclear whether Syria was involved or if there discussion was unrelated. Based on the given documents, it is likely that the illegal arms trade aided in the spread of the disease, but was not the sole reason for the quick spread.""

Most of these communications include discussions about transferring large sums of money, and many discuss meeting in Dubai, specifically between the dates of April 17 and April 19, 2009. Some of these communications mention meeting a person named Nicolai, which is likely referencing Nicolai Kuryakin, a known arms dealer. While different countries seem to have different codewords and methods regarding the arms trade, for example people from Turkey saying they plan to buy textbooks while Dr. George of Nigeria references funding to improve waterways, it is possible that the pandemic had spread due to this larger arms trade coordinated by Russian sources, especially with the meeting in Dubai in April 2009 between people arriving from these various countries.""

This is because they were mentioning a professor from Moscow where many arms dealing trades took place. This was also late 2008 so before the major crisis. I believe that the spread of this disease started through these trades as the path of the disease was from Nigeria, to Kenya, all the way to Syria first. This isn't a coincidence as even though they were neighbors in land, their trade deals with foreign countries allowed for the spread of the unknown disease and their continued involvement even after reports had been shown of medical obituaries they continued to make trades. These arms would most likely be used by either the police or the army which would allow for easy spread of a foreign disease. The Russians were also talking to a an name Thabiti Otieno who was one of the first people to pass away from a hospital and he had the most contact with the foreign arms dealers in Russia.""

From what I gather, the disease was spreading at the time they planned to meet in Paris, and so they moved a major gun deal to Dubai instead. It seems Salem got sick, probably with the virus, and died before said deal. I think if there is a correlation between the gun deal and the virus it's most likely to be from Salem to Mikail. However, I think there is little evidence to support this claim. There seems to be no evidence of chemical warfare and any mentions of the illness are just to mention the inconvenience. I do not think there is a correlation. Dr. George and Mikhail speak of public health ministry, this could be speaking about inflicting the virus or healing the virus but there is not sufficient information. Conclusion remains the same. No further questions.""
